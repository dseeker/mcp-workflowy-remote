# ADR-003: Sharing and Collaboration Features

## Status
**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2025-08-29  
**Authors**: System Architect  
**Reviewers**: Development Team  

## Context and Problem Statement

Workflowy's collaboration features are a core differentiator, enabling teams to work together on shared documents with granular permission controls. The current MCP server implementation lacks any sharing functionality, preventing users from managing collaborative workflows programmatically. This limits the server's utility for team-based AI assistance and automated collaboration management.

What architectural problem are we solving?
- Missing collaborative workflow support in the MCP server
- Inability to manage sharing permissions programmatically
- Lack of visibility into shared document states
- No API access to Workflowy's native collaboration features

## Decision Drivers

* **Collaboration Enablement**: Support team workflows and shared document management
* **Permission Management**: Granular control over access levels and sharing scope
* **Security Requirements**: Safe handling of sharing permissions and URL management
* **AI Team Assistance**: Enable AI to help manage collaborative documents
* **Workflow Automation**: Programmatic sharing setup and management
* **Audit Capabilities**: Track and manage shared content across organizations

## Considered Options

1. **Basic Sharing Only**: Implement simple share/unshare operations without permission granularity
2. **Comprehensive Collaboration Suite**: Full permission management with all sharing features
3. **Read-Only Sharing Management**: Focus on visibility and monitoring without modification
4. **Security-First Implementation**: Enhanced security features with audit trails

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: Comprehensive Collaboration Suite - Full permission management with all sharing features

### Positive Consequences

* **Complete Collaboration Support**: Teams can manage all sharing workflows programmatically
* **Granular Permission Control**: Fine-tuned access management for different collaboration needs
* **Enhanced Security**: Proper permission management reduces accidental over-sharing
* **AI-Powered Collaboration**: Enable sophisticated AI assistance for team document management
* **Workflow Integration**: Seamless integration with existing team processes

### Negative Consequences

* **Security Complexity**: Sharing operations require careful permission validation
* **Higher Token Usage**: Permission management operations generate detailed responses
* **Implementation Complexity**: Multiple permission levels and sharing states to handle

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Basic Sharing Only

**Pros**:
* Simple implementation with lower security risk
* Fast development timeline
* Minimal token usage

**Cons**:

* Increased testing requirements for security scenarios

### Option 3: Read-Only Sharing Management

**Pros**:
* Lower security risk profile
* Good visibility for audit purposes
* Simpler implementation than full management

**Cons**:
* Cannot manage sharing workflows programmatically
* Limited utility for team collaboration
* Incomplete feature set

### Option 4: Security-First Implementation

**Pros**:

## Implementation Notes

### Key Changes Required
1. **share_node operation** - Create and manage shared documents - **Est: 2,000 tokens**
2. **Permission level management** - Four-tier permission system - **Est: 3,000 tokens**
3. **URL sharing operations** - Public URL management - **Est: 2,500 tokens**
4. **Sharing state queries** - List and monitor shared content - **Est: 1,500 tokens**
5. **Security validation framework** - Permission validation and audit - **Est: 2,000 tokens**
6. **Comprehensive testing suite** - ~35 test cases including security - **Est: 3,000 tokens**

### Permission Level Implementation

**Workflowy Permission Levels**:
```typescript
enum PermissionLevel {
  None = 0,           // No access
  View = 1,           // Read-only access
  EditAndComment = 2, // Can edit and add comments
  FullAccess = 3      // Complete control including sharing
}

interface SharePermission {
  level: PermissionLevel;
  canReshare: boolean;
  expirationDate?: Date;
  requiresAuth: boolean;
}
```

### Security Validation Framework
```typescript
class PermissionValidator {
  validateShareOperation(
    userId: string, 
    nodeId: string, 
    requestedLevel: PermissionLevel
  ): ValidationResult {
    // Validate user has permission to share at requested level
    // Check node ownership and existing sharing constraints
    // Verify permission escalation rules
  }

  validateAccessLevel(
    shareId: string,
    requestedOperation: ShareOperation
  ): boolean {
    // Validate operation is allowed for current permission level
    // Check for permission inheritance from parent nodes
    // Verify temporal access constraints
  }
}
```

### Migration Strategy

1. **Step 1: Basic sharing operations** - share_node and unshare_node - **Est: 12 requests, 8,000 tokens**
2. **Step 2: Permission level system** - Implement four-tier permissions - **Est: 15 requests, 10,000 tokens**
3. **Step 3: URL management** - Public sharing URLs - **Est: 10 requests, 7,000 tokens**
4. **Step 4: Sharing queries and monitoring** - List and track shared content - **Est: 8 requests, 5,000 tokens**
5. **Step 5: Security validation and testing** - Comprehensive security testing - **Est: 8 requests, 5,000 tokens**

### Security Considerations

**Permission Validation Requirements**:
- User must have FullAccess (level 3) to modify sharing permissions
- Cannot grant permissions higher than current user's level
- Parent node permissions constrain child node sharing
- Temporal permissions require validation on each access

**Audit and Monitoring Features**:
- Log all permission changes with user attribution
- Track sharing URL creation and access patterns
- Monitor permission escalation attempts
- Generate sharing reports for compliance

## Alternatives Considered

**Alternative 1: External Permission Service**
- Implement sharing through external permission management service
- **Rejected**: Adds complexity without leveraging native Workflowy capabilities

**Alternative 2: Share-Only Implementation**
- Focus only on creating shares without permission management
- **Rejected**: Insufficient for team collaboration workflows

**Alternative 3: Template-Based Sharing**
- Pre-configured sharing templates for common scenarios
- **Future Enhancement**: Can be added after core sharing is implemented

**Security Implementation Priority**:
- All sharing operations must include proper permission validation
- Comprehensive security testing is mandatory before deployment
- Audit logging should be implemented for all permission changes
- Permission escalation must be explicitly validated and logged
