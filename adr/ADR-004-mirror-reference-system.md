# ADR-004: Mirror/Reference System Implementation

## Status
**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2025-08-29  
**Authors**: System Architect  
**Reviewers**: Development Team  

## Context and Problem Statement

Workflowy's mirror system enables the same content to appear in multiple locations while maintaining a single source of truth. This supports real Workflowy usage patterns like having the same agenda template appear across multiple meeting lists, or having recurring task lists appear in different project contexts. The current MCP server lacks compound operations for creating and managing these mirror networks efficiently.

What architectural problem are we solving?
- **Mirror Network Creation**: Users need single operations to create template/content references across multiple locations
- **Cross-Reference Management**: Creating bidirectional links and maintaining reference networks requires multiple API calls
- **Template Distribution**: Distributing recurring structures (agendas, checklists) to multiple contexts is inefficient
- **Reference Resolution**: Following mirror chains and understanding content relationships requires complex orchestration

## Decision Drivers

* **Template Reuse**: Support common Workflowy patterns like recurring agendas, checklists, and structures
* **Network Creation Efficiency**: Single operations to create mirror networks across multiple contexts
* **Bidirectional Linking**: Create and maintain cross-references that work in both directions
* **Mirror Resolution**: Intelligent resolution of mirror chains to find original content
* **Content Consistency**: Ensure mirrors maintain single source of truth while providing context
* **Template Distribution**: Efficiently distribute templates and structures to multiple locations

## Considered Options

1. **Individual Mirror Operations**: Basic create_mirror(), get_mirrors(), resolve_mirror() operations
2. **Template Distribution System**: Compound operations for distributing templates across contexts
3. **Mirror Network Management**: Operations for creating and managing connected mirror networks
4. **Cross-Reference Automation**: Intelligent bidirectional linking and reference management

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: Template Distribution System - Compound operations for distributing templates across contexts

### Positive Consequences

  createIn: ["weekly-standup", "monthly-review", "quarterly-planning"],
  linkType: "mirror" // creates live mirrors vs static copies
}): Promise<CrossReferenceResult> {
  // Internally orchestrates:
  // 1. get_node_by_id(sourceId) - Get template structure
  // 2. For each target: search_nodes() to find or create context
  // 3. create_mirror() - Mirror template into each location  
  // 4. update_node() - Add cross-reference notes for discoverability
  
  const template = await this.getNodeById(sourceId);
  const results = [];
  
  for (const targetContext of createIn) {
    const targetList = await this.findOrCreateContext(targetContext);
    const mirror = await this.createMirror(sourceId, targetList.id);
    
    // Add bidirectional reference for discoverability
    await this.updateNode(template.id, {
      note: template.note + `\n→ Used in: ${targetContext}`
    });
    
    results.push({
      targetContext,
      mirrorId: mirror.id,
      targetListId: targetList.id
    });
  }
  
  return {
    sourceId,
    distributionCount: results.length,
    references: results
  };
}

  // Find all mirrors of a node
  async getMirrors(nodeId: string): Promise<MirrorNode[]> {
    const relationshipGraph = await this.buildMirrorGraph();
    return this.traverseMirrorNetwork(nodeId, relationshipGraph);
  }

  // Resolve mirror to original content
  async resolveMirror(mirrorId: string): Promise<Node> {
    const mirrorNode = await this.getNode(mirrorId);
    
    if (!mirrorNode.isMirror) {
      return mirrorNode; // Already original content
    }
    
    // Traverse to original through mirror chain
    return this.resolveToOriginal(mirrorNode.originalId);
  }

  // Validate no circular references
  private validateNonCircular(originalId: string, targetParentId: string): void {
    // Use DFS to detect cycles in mirror relationship graph
    const visited = new Set<string>();
    const recursionStack = new Set<string>();
    
    if (this.hasCycle(originalId, targetParentId, visited, recursionStack)) {
      throw new Error('Circular mirror reference detected');
    }
  }

## Alternatives Considered

**Alternative 1: Simple Reference Links**
- Implement basic node references without full mirror functionality
- **Rejected**: Doesn't provide the full linked-thinking capabilities of Workflowy mirrors

**Alternative 2: External Graph Database**
- Store mirror relationships in dedicated graph database
- **Future Enhancement**: May be considered for very large documents with complex mirror networks

**Alternative 3: Lazy Mirror Resolution**
- Only resolve mirror content when explicitly requested
- **Partial Adoption**: Will be used for performance optimization while maintaining full functionality

**Linked Thinking Implementation Priority**:
- Mirror operations must maintain content consistency and single source of truth
- Circular reference detection is mandatory for all mirror creation operations
- Graph algorithms should be optimized for performance in large documents
- Comprehensive testing must include complex mirror relationship scenarios
