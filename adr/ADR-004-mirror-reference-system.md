# ADR-004: Mirror/Reference System Implementation

## Status
**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2025-08-29  
**Authors**: System Architect  
**Reviewers**: Development Team  

## Context and Problem Statement

Workflowy's mirror/reference system is a powerful feature that enables linked thinking and cross-referencing within documents. Mirrors allow the same content to appear in multiple locations while maintaining a single source of truth. This enables sophisticated knowledge management workflows, but the current MCP server lacks any mirror functionality, preventing AI assistants from understanding or managing these linked relationships.

What architectural problem are we solving?
- Missing support for Workflowy's advanced linked-thinking capabilities
- Inability to understand or manage cross-references in documents
- No programmatic access to mirror relationships and original content
- Limited AI context about content relationships and dependencies

## Decision Drivers

* **Linked Thinking Support**: Enable AI to understand and work with interconnected content
* **Knowledge Management**: Support sophisticated information architecture patterns
* **Content Relationship Awareness**: Provide context about how content relates across the document
* **Advanced AI Workflows**: Enable AI to create and manage content relationships
* **Data Integrity**: Ensure mirror operations maintain content consistency
* **Performance Optimization**: Efficient handling of mirrored content without duplication

## Considered Options

1. **Basic Mirror Detection**: Only identify mirrors without creation or management capabilities
2. **Comprehensive Mirror Management**: Full mirror creation, resolution, and relationship tracking
3. **Read-Only Mirror Analysis**: Focus on understanding existing mirrors without modification
4. **Advanced Relationship Mapping**: Include dependency graphs and relationship visualization

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: Comprehensive Mirror Management - Full mirror creation, resolution, and relationship tracking

### Positive Consequences

* **Complete Linked Thinking Support**: AI can understand and create sophisticated content relationships
* **Enhanced Knowledge Management**: Support for complex information architecture patterns
* **Content Consistency**: Proper mirror management maintains single source of truth

* **Scalable Architecture**: Efficient handling of large documents with multiple mirrors

### Negative Consequences

* **Implementation Complexity**: Mirror relationships require sophisticated tracking and validation
* **Performance Considerations**: Mirror resolution can be computationally expensive
* **Data Consistency Challenges**: Complex state management for mirrored content updates

  originalId: string;
  isMirror: boolean;
  mirrorLevel: number;     // Depth in mirror chain
  lastSynced: Date;
  parentMirrors?: string[]; // For dependency tracking
}

  originalId: string;
  mirrorIds: string[];
  createdAt: Date;
  relationshipType: 'direct' | 'transitive';
}
```

**Graph Algorithm Implementation**:
```typescript
class MirrorManager {
  // Create mirror relationship
  async createMirror(originalId: string, targetParentId: string): Promise<MirrorNode> {
    // Validate no circular references
    this.validateNonCircular(originalId, targetParentId);
    
    // Create mirror node with reference to original
    const mirror = await this.workflowyClient.createMirrorReference(originalId, targetParentId);
    
    // Update relationship graph
    this.updateMirrorGraph(originalId, mirror.id);
    
    return mirror;
  }

  // Find all mirrors of a node
  async getMirrors(nodeId: string): Promise<MirrorNode[]> {
    const relationshipGraph = await this.buildMirrorGraph();
    return this.traverseMirrorNetwork(nodeId, relationshipGraph);
  }

  // Resolve mirror to original content
  async resolveMirror(mirrorId: string): Promise<Node> {
    const mirrorNode = await this.getNode(mirrorId);
    
    if (!mirrorNode.isMirror) {
      return mirrorNode; // Already original content
    }
    
    // Traverse to original through mirror chain
    return this.resolveToOriginal(mirrorNode.originalId);
  }

  // Validate no circular references
  private validateNonCircular(originalId: string, targetParentId: string): void {
    // Use DFS to detect cycles in mirror relationship graph
    const visited = new Set<string>();
    const recursionStack = new Set<string>();
    
    if (this.hasCycle(originalId, targetParentId, visited, recursionStack)) {
      throw new Error('Circular mirror reference detected');
    }
  }
}
```

## Alternatives Considered

**Alternative 1: Simple Reference Links**
- Implement basic node references without full mirror functionality

- **Future Enhancement**: May be considered for very large documents with complex mirror networks

**Alternative 3: Lazy Mirror Resolution**
- Only resolve mirror content when explicitly requested
- **Partial Adoption**: Will be used for performance optimization while maintaining full functionality
