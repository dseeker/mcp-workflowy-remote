## Context and Problem Statement

The MCP Workflowy server currently implements only 5 out of 9 core Workflowy operations, representing 14% coverage of essential functionality. Critical operations like `move_node` and `delete_node` are missing, severely limiting the server's utility for comprehensive Workflowy management. Additionally, the `delete_node` operation exists in the codebase but is commented out, indicating incomplete implementation.

What architectural problem are we solving?
- Incomplete CRUD operations for Workflowy nodes
- Missing essential node manipulation capabilities
- Commented-out critical functionality that needs to be properly implemented and tested

## Decision Drivers

* **Functionality Completeness**: Users need basic CRUD operations to manage their Workflowy data effectively
* **API Parity**: Should match core Workflowy web interface capabilities
* **User Experience**: Missing operations create workflow interruptions and force users to switch contexts
* **Development Efficiency**: Existing infrastructure and testing framework can support rapid implementation
* **Token Budget Constraints**: Implementation should leverage existing patterns to minimize LLM token usage
* **Reliability Requirements**: All operations must be thoroughly tested and error-handled

## Considered Options

1. **Implement All Missing Operations Simultaneously**: Complete all 4 missing core operations at once
2. **Phased Implementation with Testing**: Implement operations incrementally with comprehensive testing
3. **Minimal Implementation**: Only implement move_node and enable delete_node without additional features
4. **Extended Implementation**: Include additional metadata and validation features beyond basic operations

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: Phased Implementation with Testing - Implement operations incrementally with comprehensive testing

### Positive Consequences

* **Reduced Risk**: Incremental implementation allows for thorough testing and validation at each step
* **Maintainable Codebase**: Follows established patterns and testing infrastructure
* **Quick User Value**: Users get critical functionality faster than waiting for complete implementation
* **Quality Assurance**: Each operation is thoroughly tested before moving to the next
* **Token Efficiency**: Leverages existing code patterns and infrastructure

### negative Consequences

* **Extended Timeline**: Takes longer than simultaneous implementation
* **Coordination Overhead**: Requires careful planning and dependency management
* **Incomplete Feature Set**: Users may encounter partial functionality during implementation phases

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Implement All Missing Operations Simultaneously

**Pros**:
* Fastest time to complete feature set
* Users get all functionality at once
* No intermediate incomplete states

**Cons**:
* Higher risk of introducing bugs across multiple operations
* Difficult to debug and test comprehensively
* Large token usage for simultaneous development
* Potential for regression in existing functionality

### Option 2: Phased Implementation with Testing

**Pros**:
* Lower risk through incremental validation
* Leverages existing testing infrastructure
* Maintains code quality standards
* Easier to debug and maintain
* Follows established development patterns

**Cons**:
* Longer timeline to completion
* Users experience incomplete functionality temporarily
* Requires more coordination and planning

### Option 3: Minimal Implementation

**Pros**:
* Fastest implementation time
* Addresses most critical user needs
* Lower complexity and token usage

**Cons**:
* Missing important functionality (get_node_by_id)
* Doesn't establish pattern for future operations
* May require rework for additional features

### Option 4: Extended Implementation

**Pros**:
* Comprehensive feature set with enhanced capabilities
* Future-proofs the implementation
* Better user experience

**Cons**:
* Significantly higher token usage
* Longer development time
* Higher complexity and maintenance burden

## Alternatives Considered

**Alternative 1: Skip move_node Implementation**
- Focus only on delete_node and get_node_by_id
- **Rejected**: move_node is the most requested missing functionality according to roadmap analysis

**Alternative 2: Implement Advanced Error Recovery**
- Add sophisticated retry logic and error handling
- **Deferred**: Can be added in future phases once basic operations are stable

**Alternative 3: Batch Operation Implementation**
- Implement basic operations as part of a larger batch system
- **Rejected**: Adds unnecessary complexity for immediate user needs
