# Workflowy MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with Workflowy. This server provides an MCP-compatible interface to Workflowy, allowing AI assistants to interact with your Workflowy lists programmatically.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for AI models to interact with external tools and APIs. This server implements MCP to allow AI assistants (like ChatGPT) to read and manipulate your Workflowy lists through a set of defined tools.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Remote Server (Recommended)

Use our hosted server - no setup required:

```bash
# Add the remote MCP server using Claude Code CLI
claude mcp add --transport http workflowy-remote https://mcp-workflowy-remote.daniel-bca.workers.dev/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer ********="

# Verify connection
claude mcp list
```

### Option 2: Local Server

![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/mcp-workflowy) ![NPM Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/mcp-workflowy)

```bash
# Install and run locally
npm install -g mcp-workflowy
mcp-workflowy server start

# Or use npx
npx mcp-workflowy server start
```

## ‚ú® Features

- **üîó Workflowy Integration**: Connect to your Workflowy account with username/password
- **üåê Multiple Deployment Options**: Local server or remote Cloudflare Workers
- **üîí Secure Authentication**: API key protection with client-provided credentials
- **‚ö° Intelligent Metadata Hydration**: Enriched responses with context like parentName, hierarchy, siblings
- **üéØ Workflowy-Focused Operations**: Operations designed for real Workflowy usage patterns
- **üõ†Ô∏è Complete CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete, and move nodes
- **üìä Smart Defaults**: Optimized for performance with minimal token usage
- **üîç Advanced Search**: Filter by depth, fields, preview length, and result limits

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Operations

### Core Operations
1. **list_nodes** - List nodes with intelligent metadata hydration
2. **search_nodes** - Search with advanced filtering and context enrichment
3. **get_node_by_id** - Get single node with full relationship details
4. **create_node** - Create new nodes with smart positioning
5. **update_node** - Modify existing nodes with validation
6. **delete_node** - Remove nodes safely
7. **move_node** - Reorganize nodes with priority control
8. **toggle_complete** - Mark completion with timestamp tracking

### Enhanced Capabilities
- **Smart Field Selection**: Use `includeFields` to request specific metadata
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Automatic hydration of parentName, hierarchy, siblings
- **Performance Optimization**: Only fetches requested metadata to minimize API calls
- **Workflowy-Native Patterns**: Operations aligned with real Workflowy workflows

## üí° Example Usage

The MCP server enables natural AI interactions with your Workflowy data:

### Basic Operations
- *"Show all my notes on project XYZ in Workflowy"*
- *"Review the codebase, mark all completed notes as completed"*
- *"Given my milestones on Workflowy for this project, suggest what my next task should be"*

### Enhanced with Metadata
- *"Search for 'meeting' and show me the parent context for each result"*
- *"Find all incomplete items and tell me their hierarchy path"*
- *"List my grocery list with completion status and priority order"*

### Smart Field Selection
```javascript
// Request only basic fields for performance
{ "includeFields": ["id", "name", "isCompleted"] }

// Request enhanced context for analysis
{ "includeFields": ["name", "parentName", "hierarchy", "siblings", "priority"] }
```
