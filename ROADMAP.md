*With comprehensive test coverage for all new features*

## Testing-First Development Process

With the established test infrastructure, all new feature development follows this process:

### 1. Test-Driven Development
```bash
# Before implementing any new feature:
1. Add mock responses to src/test/mocks/workflowy-responses.ts
2. Add unit tests to src/test/workflowy-tools-simple.test.ts
3. Add integration tests if needed to src/test/integration-basic.test.ts
4. Run tests to verify they fail: npm test
5. Implement the feature
6. Run tests to verify they pass: npm test
7. Check coverage: npm run test:coverage
```

### 2. Regression Testing
```bash
# Before merging any changes:
1. Full test suite: npm test (must be 22+ tests passing)
2. Coverage check: npm run test:coverage (maintain coverage levels)
3. Build verification: npm run build && npm run build:worker
4. Manual testing with Claude Code if needed
5. Remote deployment verification (if deploying): npm run deploy
```

### 3. Adding New Operations
When implementing Phase 1 operations (move_node, delete_node, get_node_by_id):

1. **Extend mock system** - Add responses for new operations
2. **Add unit tests** - Follow existing test patterns
3. **Update integration tests** - Verify tool structure
4. **Test error scenarios** - Auth failures, not found, etc.
5. **Maintain coverage** - Ensure 80%+ coverage maintained

This ensures all future development is reliable and regression-free.
