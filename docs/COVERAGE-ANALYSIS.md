- **Integration**: HTTP clients, webhook servers, plugin sandboxing

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Security Implementation** (Phases 2, 6, 10) - Requires expert security review
2. **Real-time Synchronization** (Phase 6) - Complex conflict resolution algorithms  
3. **Plugin Architecture** (Phase 10) - Sandboxing and security isolation
4. **Performance at Scale** (All phases) - Large document handling optimization

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Implementation** - One phase at a time with full testing
2. **Security-First Design** - Security review at each phase
3. **Performance Testing** - Load testing with large Workflowy documents
4. **Community Validation** - Beta testing with real users

## Conclusion

Achieving **80%+ coverage** is feasible through systematic implementation of the 10 ADRs. The roadmap provides:

- **Clear path to 85% coverage** through Phases 0-8
- **Enterprise-ready 95% coverage** with advanced integration features  
- **Realistic token budgets** and implementation timelines
- **Risk mitigation strategies** for complex features

The recommended approach is to implement Phases 0-5 first (85% coverage) before tackling advanced real-time and enterprise features.
